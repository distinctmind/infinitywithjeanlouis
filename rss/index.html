Or does it entrap you in more inauthentic circumstances?</p><p>If you hate being a lawyer, but you set the goal of being the best lawyer in your district and when you get that fat paycheck, then you'll feel happy and full. When you get there, you'll just be further trapped in a world that you hate.</p><p>Are you expanding into a world you love? Or are you expanding into a world you despise?</p><p>You know your goal is a <strong>true goal</strong> when you feel excited to expand into that reality because <em>it's a reality that represents <strong>more of your true self</strong></em>.</p><p>Example, for me, my true goal is reaching a certain $$$/month from my online business. That reality is exciting for my soul because it represents financial independence, it represents the reality where I wake up and cash is flowing into my bank account without me having to work that much, it represents the reality where I can go on a trip and not have to worry about making money or having to cash in vacation days.</p><blockquote>Every day is a vacation day.</blockquote><p>In other words, financial independence through online business is my goal. Of course my goal is more specific, but I keep that for myself for the time being.</p><p>Me achieving that goal is me expanding into more freedom, me expanding into a world that represents more of my true self, that lets me be and express more of my authenticity.</p><blockquote>Are your goals freeing you?</blockquote><h2 id="believe-you-can-get-to-your-destination-">Believe you can get to your destination.</h2><p>Now, you have set a true goal, you've successfully completed the first step.</p><p>If you have a goal but you don't actually believe you can get there, then don't even bother trying. </p><p>Now, I'm being harsh for the sake of proving a point. But when you doubt if you can get to where you wanna go, you create <strong>split energy</strong> and that split energy is what will cause you unnecessary suffering.</p><p>So, you must believe with all your heart that your destination is possible for you to reach.</p><p>Going back to my example, I must believe that it's truly possible for me to make x$$$/month from my business. </p><p>I must believe it to be true just like I believe the fact that I can get eggs at the grocery store.</p><p>You just go towards your destination, no fighting.</p><blockquote>When you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water. This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolution. Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. <br>His goal attracts him, because <strong>he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal</strong>.<br><br><strong>-Siddharta</strong></blockquote><p>You cannot have any opposition between you and your goal.</p><blockquote>You and your goal must be one Now.</blockquote><p>Believe and know it is already yours and work backwards.</p><p>Every goal that you desire to achieve comes with a <strong>process</strong>.</p><p>Let me repeat this.</p><p>There is a process for you to get to where you wanna go.</p><p>Focus and <strong>devote yourself to the process</strong> that will get you there.</p><p>That's it. It's that simple</p><p>Focus and devote yourself to the process day-in day-out until you reach your destination.</p><p>Of course, you might have to make changes to your process, but don't forget to have fun everyday working towards your true goals!</p><p>Have more fun in the process of working towards your true goals than reaching them - this is the key to happiness.</p><p>My process is: <strong>building my online business.</strong></p><p>In this process, I have two sub-processes:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>Create</li>
<li>Sell</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Each sub-process is a different flow-zone. </p><p>I enjoy being both the creator and seller. </p><p>I enjoy being an entrepreneur.</p><p>I enjoy creating an online business.</p><p>I enjoy everyday.</p><p>Peace. Love.

You are surviving. </p><p>You see, this thought of "I need to make money" will directly engage your ego.</p><p>How could you ever trust life, if in the back of your mind, you're constantly thinking "How can I make money? I need to make money!"</p><p>The truth is that the <em>"I need to make money"</em> is a <strong>low-vibe</strong> thought.</p><p>Life is not about your love when you start thinking how you can make money.</p><p>So, enough bitching. Will we ever be able to trust in life and stop worrying about ego-stuff?</p><p>Of course.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l2YWr3bI5U1bHOzuM/giphy.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Trust your Highest Joy and Raise Your Vibe"></figure><p>Before I talk about how to trust life and have fun, let's talk about why it's easy for us to be engaged in ego thoughts.</p><p>It's easy because we are afraid of what we can't predict, of what we can't see.</p><blockquote>Most of us are conditioned to be afraid of the unknown.</blockquote><p><strong>Your mind cannot see jack shit!</strong></p><p>Because your mind can't see jack shit, it's afraid to trust your heart, so it goes in clinging to things outside of you to feel safe and secure.</p><p>But the only way out is to trust your heart NOW.</p><p>Life becomes a fun and amazing magical journey when you start trusting your heart NOW even when the mind can't see jack shit.</p><blockquote><strong>Your heart can lead the way.</strong></blockquote><p>How about we let life support us.</p><p>We've been conditioned to think and believe that we need to get in our way and <strong>survive and support what is already supported</strong>. So of course, most of us suffer.. </p><p>It's like if you are on a perfectly designed ship in the sea and someone on board of the ship says to you "This boat is not stable, you might drown, you need to find a way to survive."</p><p>So, you spend the entire trip of the ship in complete worry and stress trying to figure out how to not drown and survive. But from an objective perspective, you've completely wasted your time and created your own suffering because you chose to believe in an incorrect thought. The boat is fine, the boat is stable, you will not drown, you can enjoy the trip while letting go of control and being free. However, your beliefs prevented you from seeing the truth.</p><p>This is life.</p><p>Your beliefs about the truth of life will determine whether you can enjoy the ride or stress about it all the way until its destination (death).</p><p>Life is the river. The river is more stable than your great-grand-father in war. </p><p>It's stable af.</p><p>Ultimately, you are a part of this river. You and this river of life are one.</p><p>This river will support you. In other words, <strong>life will support you</strong>.</p><p>But if you believe that it won't, then you are just fighting with yourself.</p><p>So, let go of trying to survive, let go of trying to make money, stop entertaining the thoughts of needing to make money.</p><p>The more you energize and entertain those thoughts, the more powerless you feel and the less you trust life.</p><p>And instead come back to the truth of life.</p><p>You are in the river of life NOW.</p><p>This river is and always will support you! </p><p>You can trust it.</p><p>You can do what you love, follow and act on your highest joy, feel good on the ride and never have to worry about how to make money because your excitement and joy always support you.</p><p>Now, maybe you're smart and you ask yourself "Why will life support me following my joy?"</p><p>Because that's the point of life, to listen to your joys, to listen to your love and to live it, to live your highest excitement, to have fun and to be in love with the ride, to be ecstatic.</p><p>Life will support your journey of being blissful.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surrender Meditation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>One thing I love most about life is the Sun. </p><p>Its warmth and power invigorates my soul and fulfills it deeply.</p><p>Whenever the Sun decides to shine, I am always inspired to meditate with it, and so today when the Sun shined through my room window, I decided to bring</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/surrender-meditation/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ff77338c9b3c1b0a911dded</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeanlouis]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:10:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One thing I love most about life is the Sun. </p><p>Its warmth and power invigorates my soul and fulfills it deeply.</p><p>Whenever the Sun decides to shine, I am always inspired to meditate with it, and so today when the Sun shined through my room window, I decided to bring a chair in my room and meditate with it.</p><p>Before this meditation, I was browsing instagram and I saw a post with a quote from Bashar:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Surrender is actually allowing control because you are already in control.<br>
 <br>
When you believe you have to make things happen or force things to happen instead of just allowing them to happen... then you actually believe you are not in control... that things won't work out automatically.<br>
 <br>
When you surrender you are actually giving over to the fact that things are already perfectly under control.&quot;<br>
 <br>
-<strong>Bashar</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I really resonated with this quote because it connected with my inner-being, that everything is already perfectly happening, there is already a divine intelligence that knows how to give me what I desire, I can yield my ego to the Source.</p><p>I can surrender to life, to God, to Source, whatever name you want to give it, ultimately, you stop trying to control the world through your ego and you surrender in the beauty of the world because its meaning is simply to enjoy living it, to be in joy Now.</p><p>So, as I meditated, I started to affirm myself these two really powerful affirmations:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>I am already in control</li>
<li>I surrender</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>And, as I kept going deeper and deeper and allowing myself to return to the center-point of my being that is already perfectly in control and safe and secure, I could feel an intense shift, I felt as though I was converging into a massive space inside of me, it was so intense that I interrupted my meditation.</p><p>But I haven't gone that far in meditation in a long time, I think I will definitely try this type of meditation again.</p><p>The reason why I really loved this meditation is because one of my "problems" that causes me suffering is the clinging to my ego and afraid to surrender. I am afraid to surrender to life in fear that it may not work out, that life can't get me what I want, that I have to somehow control everything to get it my way, but in-doing-so I just complicate the process and get in my own way.</p><p>Surrendering to the already perfect-ness and whole-ness of this Now moment allows me to Be in this moment with an open-heart and a deep sense of belief that all-that-I-desire is already on its way to me.</p><p>Ask and you shall receive.</p><p>It's that simple, you ask the Universe and it will give it to you, but you must be able to receive it, and to receive it is to be a match to it, to feel like you are worthy of it Now.</p><p>Trust life, for life is the intelligence that will give you what you want anyways, might as well trust it.</p><p>And the fullness of life is Here Now, so trust the Here &amp; Now. </p><p>Trust it deeply, love it and surrender to it. </p><p>There is nowhere else to go anyways 😉</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
