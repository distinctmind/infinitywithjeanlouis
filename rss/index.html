<p>&quot;Surrender is actually allowing control because you are already in control.<br>
Â <br>
When you believe you have to make things happen or force things to happen instead of just allowing them to happen... then you actually believe you are not in control... that things won't work out automatically.<br>
Â <br>
When you surrender you are actually giving over to the fact that things are already perfectly under control.&quot;<br>
Â <br>
-<strong>Bashar</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I really resonated with this quote because it connected with my inner-being, that everything is already perfectly happening, there is already a divine intelligence that knows how to give me what I desire, I can yield my ego to the Source.</p><p>I can surrender to life, to God, to Source, whatever name you want to give it, ultimately, you stop trying to control the world through your ego and you surrender in the beauty of the world because its meaning is simply to enjoy living it, to be in joy Now.</p><p>So, as I meditated, I started to affirm myself these two really powerful affirmations:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>I am already in control</li>
<li>I surrender</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>And, as I kept going deeper and deeper and allowing myself to return to the center-point of my being that is already perfectly in control and safe and secure, I could feel an intense shift, I felt as though I was converging into a massive space inside of me, it was so intense that I interrupted my meditation.</p><p>But I haven't gone that far in meditation in a long time, I think I will definitely try this type of meditation again.</p><p>The reason why I really loved this meditation is because one of my "problems" that causes me suffering is the clinging to my ego and afraid to surrender. I am afraid to surrender to life in fear that it may not work out, that life can't get me what I want, that I have to somehow control everything to get it my way, but in-doing-so I just complicate the process and get in my own way.</p><p>Surrendering to the already perfect-ness and whole-ness of this Now moment allows me to Be in this moment with an open-heart and a deep sense of belief that all-that-I-desire is already on its way to me.</p><p>Ask and you shall receive.</p><p>It's that simple, you ask the Universe and it will give it to you, but you must be able to receive it, and to receive it is to be a match to it, to feel like you are worthy of it Now.</p><p>Trust life, for life is the intelligence that will give you what you want anyways, might as well trust it.</p><p>And the fullness of life is Here Now, so trust the Here &amp; Now. </p><p>Trust it deeply, love it and surrender to it. </p><p>There is nowhere else to go anyways ðŸ˜‰</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
