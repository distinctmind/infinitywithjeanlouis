You are surviving. </p><p>You see, this thought of "I need to make money" will directly engage your ego.</p><p>How could you ever trust life, if in the back of your mind, you're constantly thinking "How can I make money? I need to make money!"</p><p>The truth is that the <em>"I need to make money"</em> is a <strong>low-vibe</strong> thought.</p><p>Life is not about your love when you start thinking how you can make money.</p><p>So, enough bitching. Will we ever be able to trust in life and stop worrying about ego-stuff?</p><p>Of course.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l2YWr3bI5U1bHOzuM/giphy.gif" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>Before I talk about how to trust life and have fun, let's talk about why it's easy for us to be engaged in ego thoughts.</p><p>It's easy because we are afraid of what we can't predict, of what we can't see.</p><blockquote>Most of us are conditioned to be afraid of the unknown.</blockquote><p><strong>Your mind cannot see jack shit!</strong></p><p>Because your mind can't see jack shit, it's afraid to trust your heart, so it goes in clinging to things outside of you to feel safe and secure.</p><p>But the only way out is to trust your heart NOW.</p><p>Life becomes a fun and amazing magical journey when you start trusting your heart NOW even when the mind can't see jack shit.</p><blockquote><strong>Your heart can lead the way.</strong></blockquote><p>How about we let life support us.</p><p>We've been conditioned to think and believe that we need to get in our way and <strong>survive and support what is already supported</strong>. So of course, most of us suffer.. </p><p>It's like if you are on a perfectly designed ship in the sea and someone on board of the ship says to you "This boat is not stable, you might drown, you need to find a way to survive."</p><p>So, you spend the entire trip of the ship in complete worry and stress trying to figure out how to not drown and survive. But from an objective perspective, you've completely wasted your time and created your own suffering because you chose to believe in an incorrect thought. The boat is fine, the boat is stable, you will not drown, you can enjoy the trip while letting go of control and being free. However, your beliefs prevented you from seeing the truth.</p><p>This is life.</p><p>Your beliefs about the truth of life will determine whether you can enjoy the ride or stress about it all the way until its destination (death).</p><p>Life is the river. The river is more stable than your great-grand-father in war. </p><p>It's stable af.</p><p>Ultimately, you are a part of this river. You and this river of life are one.</p><p>This river will support you. In other words, <strong>life will support you</strong>.</p><p>But if you believe that it won't, then you are just fighting with yourself.</p><p>So, let go of trying to survive, let go of trying to make money, stop entertaining the thoughts of needing to make money.</p><p>The more you energize and entertain those thoughts, the more powerless you feel and the less you trust life.</p><p>And instead come back to the truth of life.</p><p>You are in the river of life NOW.</p><p>This river is and always will support you! </p><p>You can trust it.</p><p>You can do what you love, follow and act on your highest joy, feel good on the ride and never have to worry about how to make money because your excitement and joy always support you.</p><p>Now, maybe you're smart and you ask yourself "Why will life support me following my joy?"</p><p>Because that's the point of life, to listen to your joys, to listen to your love and to live it, to live your highest excitement, to have fun and to be in love with the ride, to be ecstatic.</p><p>Life will support your journey of being blissful.</p><p></p>
