Or does it entrap you in more inauthentic circumstances?</p><p>If you hate being a lawyer, but you set the goal of being the best lawyer in your district and when you get that fat paycheck, then you'll feel happy and full. When you get there, you'll just be further trapped in a world that you hate.</p><p>Are you expanding into a world you love? Or are you expanding into a world you despise?</p><p>You know your goal is a <strong>true goal</strong> when you feel excited to expand into that reality because <em>it's a reality that represents <strong>more of your true self</strong></em>.</p><p>Example, for me, my true goal is reaching a certain $$$/month from my online business. That reality is exciting for my soul because it represents financial independence, it represents the reality where I wake up and cash is flowing into my bank account without me having to work that much, it represents the reality where I can go on a trip and not have to worry about making money or having to cash in vacation days.</p><blockquote>Every day is a vacation day.</blockquote><p>In other words, financial independence through online business is my goal. Of course my goal is more specific, but I keep that for myself for the time being.</p><p>Me achieving that goal is me expanding into more freedom, me expanding into a world that represents more of my true self, that lets me be and express more of my authenticity.</p><blockquote>Are your goals freeing you?</blockquote><h2 id="believe-you-can-get-to-your-destination-">Believe you can get to your destination.</h2><p>Now, you have set a true goal, you've successfully completed the first step.</p><p>If you have a goal but you don't actually believe you can get there, then don't even bother trying. </p><p>Now, I'm being harsh for the sake of proving a point. But when you doubt if you can get to where you wanna go, you create <strong>split energy</strong> and that split energy is what will cause you unnecessary suffering.</p><p>So, you must believe with all your heart that your destination is possible for you to reach.</p><p>Going back to my example, I must believe that it's truly possible for me to make x$$$/month from my business. </p><p>I must believe it to be true just like I believe the fact that I can get eggs at the grocery store.</p><p>You just go towards your destination, no fighting.</p><blockquote>When you throw a rock into the water, it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water. This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolution. Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. <br>His goal attracts him, because <strong>he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal</strong>.<br><br><strong>-Siddharta</strong></blockquote><p>You cannot have any opposition between you and your goal.</p><blockquote>You and your goal must be one Now.</blockquote><p>Believe and know it is already yours and work backwards.</p><p>Every goal that you desire to achieve comes with a <strong>process</strong>.</p><p>Let me repeat this.</p><p>There is a process for you to get to where you wanna go.</p><p>Focus and <strong>devote yourself to the process</strong> that will get you there.</p><p>That's it. It's that simple</p><p>Focus and devote yourself to the process day-in day-out until you reach your destination.</p><p>Of course, you might have to make changes to your process, but don't forget to have fun everyday working towards your true goals!</p><p>Have more fun in the process of working towards your true goals than reaching them - this is the key to happiness.</p><p>My process is: <strong>building my online business.</strong></p><p>In this process, I have two sub-processes:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>Create</li>
<li>Sell</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Each sub-process is a different flow-zone. </p><p>I enjoy being both the creator and seller. </p><p>I enjoy being an entrepreneur.</p><p>I enjoy creating an online business.</p><p>I enjoy everyday.</p><p>Peace. Love. Namaste.</p>
